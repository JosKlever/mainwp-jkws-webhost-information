## Idea
This plugin is work in progress. The idea is to add a Webhost field to evey child site in MainWP Dashboard. It's a text field tha tcan be shown in multiple places and edited via the Edit Site page.

## Disclaimer
I'm not an experienced developer, so this plugin consists of multiple snippets I've found and adjusted to my needs. I can't guarantee it will also work on other websites.

## Collaboration
